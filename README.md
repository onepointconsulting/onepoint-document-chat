# Onepoint Document Chat

Allows to chat with PDF documents based on a set of uploaded documents.

## Setup

We suggest to use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage the virtual environment and then install poetry.

```
conda activate base
conda remove -n onepoint_document_chat --all
conda create -n onepoint_document_chat python=3.11
conda activate onepoint_document_chat
pip install poetry
